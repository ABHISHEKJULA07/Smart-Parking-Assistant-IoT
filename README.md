# üöó Smart Parking Assistant using Ultrasonic Sensors & IoT

A smart and scalable parking system designed to assist drivers while parking and automate garage functions. This system integrates **ultrasonic sensors**, a **buzzer**, and **ESP32** with the **Blynk IoT platform**, offering real-time parking assistance and remote control of connected appliances.

## üìå Abstract

This system helps drivers park safely by continuously measuring the distance between the car and nearby obstacles using an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**. When the car approaches within a critical threshold (e.g., 50 cm), a buzzer is activated, and real-time alerts are sent to a mobile device via **Blynk**. Additionally, the system uses a **relay** module to control electronic devices like garage doors or lights remotely through the Blynk mobile app.

|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ESP32**         | Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller that controls the system                     |
| **HC-SR04**       | Ultrasonic sensor to measure distance between vehicle and obstacles        |
| **Buzzer**        | Audible alert when safe distance is breached                               |
| **Relay Module**  | Controls garage appliances based on user input or sensor feedback          |
| **Arduino IDE**   | Programming environment for ESP32                                           |
| **Blynk IoT**     | Mobile interface to monitor and control the system in real time            |

## üîß How It Works

1. The **ultrasonic sensor** constantly measures the distance between the vehicle and an obstacle (e.g., garage wall).
2. If the distance drops below **50 cm**, a **buzzer** is triggered to alert the driver.
3. The **ESP32** sends this data to the **Blynk mobile app** using Wi-Fi.
4. The **relay module** allows control of electrical appliances (garage light, fan, door) remotely via the app.
